    "bio": "Ramon Bong Revilla Jr. (real name: Jose Mari Mortel Bautista) is a senator in the 19th Congress, serving a fresh first term until 2025. He was previously elected to the same position in 2004 and 2010, and had to take a break in the 2016 election cycle for being term-limited under the Constitution.\n\nRevilla ranked 11th in the 2019 race for 12 seats – a winning but dismal performance compared to his previous runs. Running for a national post for the first time in 2004, but carrying the name of his outgoing senator father Ramon Revilla Sr., Bong finished with the second highest number of votes. He topped the race when he ran for reelection in 2010. Among other factors, his much lower ranking in the 2019 senatorial election was attributed by political observers in part to his trial and detention over the misuse of his pork barrel over several years.\n\nIn 2013, in the middle of Revilla’s second term as senator, a special audit by the Commission on Audit found that the Priority Development Assistance Fund of about a dozen senators, including Revilla, had been channeled to bogus non-governmental organizations in exchange for kickbacks. Plunder and graft cases were filed only against Revilla and two other opposition senators at the time: Juan Ponce Enrile and Jinggoy Estrada. Revilla was charged for having received P224 million in bribes.\n\nRevilla was detained starting June 2014, and his trial didn’t start until 2017 due to several postponements his camp requested. On December 7, 2018, the Sandiganbayan acquitted him of plunder in a close vote of 3-2, with the majority giving credence to Revilla’s defense that his signature in the transactions was forged. His chief of staff Richard Cambe and alleged mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles were convicted.\n\nThis was despite the testimony of a representative of the Anti-Money Laundering Council that a total amount of P87 million in deposits to the bank accounts of Revilla and his family matched the individual amounts and dates listed in the ledger of pork barrel scam whistleblower Benhur Luy, the assistant of Napoles. Revilla also claimed that his wealth came from his earnings as an actor, but these were not reflected in his Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth, which government officials were required to file. The minority who voted to convict Revilla said misuse of funds of that magnitude could not have happened without the knowledge of the senator.\n\nIn the 2018 ruling, the Sandiganbayan also ordered the “accused [to] solidarily and jointly” return P124 million to the national treasury. Revilla’s camp has refused to heed the order, saying that his acquittal in the criminal aspect of the case also released him from any civil liability.\n\nIn July 2021, already elected back as senator, Revilla was cleared of the 16 remaining graft charges related to the pork barrel scam.\n\nRevilla currently chairs the committee on civil service, government reorganization, and and professional regulation, which explains his bills seeking better benefits or working conditions for government workers. He has also proposed lowering the optional retirement age of government workers from 60 to 56.\n\nHe also chairs the public works committee, a position that has been given by Senate leaderships to a Revilla since the time of his father, Ramon Sr. Bong Revilla has chaired this committee in every term he served as senator.\n\nRevilla has followed in his father’s footsteps in both his careers as an actor and a politician. He entered showbusiness in 1983, doing action movies like the ones that made his father popular. He first ran for senator in 2004 when his father’s Senate term was ending. Before this, Revilla served as vice governor (elected 1995), then as governor (elected 1998), of Cavite for one term each, getting special attention and help from President Fidel Ramos’s party, Lakas-NUCD, on both counts. He lost by a considerable margin to Irineo Maliksi when he sought reelection as governor in 2001.\n\nWhile awaiting the 2004 senatorial election, Revilla was appointed by president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, then his party mate, as chairman of the Videogram Regulatory Board, the precursor of the Optical Media Board.\n\nRevilla is married to actress Lani Mercado (real name: Jesusa Hernandez-Bautista), with whom he has seven children. He has a child with a former girlfriend. His siblings, wife, and children also hold elective positions, making the Revillas the biggest political dynasty in their home province of Cavite to date.

He had lost in his first senatorial bid in 2016, placing 13th when 12 seats were available.\n\nTolentino, however, was not a greenhorn in campaigns and elections. His father, Isaac Tolentino, served as mayor of Tagaytay City for 26 year – the longest in that post – from 1954 to 1980. In 1986, newly installed president Corazon Aquino appointed Francis OIC mayor of Tagaytay. Eleven years later, in 1995, he was elected mayor, and reelected twice to serve the maximum allowed terms until 2004.\n\nHe did not return to local politics anymore, as his brother Bambol (full name: Abraham Tolentino) took over as mayor in 2004 and had been alternating with his wife in the position since. The Tolentinos are the second largest political dynasty in Cavite, as of the 2022 elections.\n\nIn 2010, Francis Tolentino was named chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority by president Benigno Aquino III. He was the first non-Manileño to have held the post. He served until 2015, resigning to prepare for his first senatorial campaign.\n\nDuring Tolentino’s time at the MMDA, the agency introduced the integrated bus terminal concept, which prohibited buses coming from his home province of Cavite from plying beyond the end of the Coastal Road in Parañaque City. A commuters’ group protested the policy, citing how it would inconvenience commuters who would have additional stops – therefore, additional cost and time – getting to their destinations. At the time, there were no connecting rides from the terminal to the city centers. This Southwest Interim Transport Terminal became the forerunner of the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange, a transport terminal servicing several provinces and a commercial center.\n\nIt was also during Tolentino’s time when the MMDA started providing real-time traffic updates via social media, and relaunched the Pasig River Ferry to ease traffic congestion in the National Capital Region.\n\nWhile he was initially considered by the Liberal Party as one of its senatorial candidates for 2016, Tolentino was dropped from the ticket after a 2015 incident, where he was alleged to have brought a girl group, which did a lewd performance at a political event of his party mate in Laguna province. He denied this, and said he was just a guest. A 2013 social media post by the group, however, indicated a connection with Tolentino – they thanked him for getting their services for his brother Abraham’s campaign.\n\nTolentino lost in the 2016 election, placing 13th. He accused the 12th winning candidate, Leila de Lima, of cheating her of the seat, and pursued a protest with the Senate Electoral Tribunal for two years, while he was serving as then-president Rodrigo Duterte’s political affairs adviser. He withdrew the protest in 2018 so he could focus on preparing for this 2019 senatorial bid, which he would eventually win.  \n\nHe currently serves as Senate majority floor leader, and chairs the committee on ethics and privileges and the committee on rules. Previously, before the leadership changes in the chamber, he chaired the committee on justice and human rights and the blue ribbon committee.\n\nIn the 18th Congress, in recognition of his experience as longtime mayor and as MMDA chief, he was named chairperson of the Senate committee on local government and of the committee on urban planning, housing, and resettlement.\n\nTolentino is a law graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University, and has earned three masterals in law from universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. An Armed Forces of the Philippines reservist, he also holds a master’s degree in national security administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines.\n\nHe is not married, but has a son that sits as the No. 1 councilor of Tagaytay City.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSee more\n\nFrancis Ng Tolentino is a senator in the 19th Congress, getting a seat on his second attempt in 2019.

He served until 2015, resigning to prepare for his first senatorial campaign.\n\nDuring Tolentino’s time at the MMDA, the agency introduced the integrated bus terminal concept, which prohibited buses coming from his home province of Cavite from plying beyond the end of the Coastal Road in Parañaque City. A commuters’ group protested the policy, citing how it would inconvenience commuters who would have additional stops – therefore, additional cost and time – getting to their destinations. At the time, there were no connecting rides from the terminal to the city centers. This Southwest Interim Transport Terminal became the forerunner of the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange, a transport terminal servicing several provinces and a commercial center.\n\nIt was also during Tolentino’s time when the MMDA started providing real-time traffic updates via social media, and relaunched the Pasig River Ferry to ease traffic congestion in the National Capital Region.\n\nWhile he was initially considered by the Liberal Party as one of its senatorial candidates for 2016, Tolentino was dropped from the ticket after a 2015 incident, where he was alleged to have brought a girl group, which did a lewd performance at a political event of his party mate in Laguna province. He denied this, and said he was just a guest. A 2013 social media post by the group, however, indicated a connection with Tolentino – they thanked him for getting their services for his brother Abraham’s campaign.\n\nTolentino lost in the 2016 election, placing 13th. He accused the 12th winning candidate, Leila de Lima, of cheating her of the seat, and pursued a protest with the Senate Electoral Tribunal for two years, while he was serving as then-president Rodrigo Duterte’s political affairs adviser. He withdrew the protest in 2018 so he could focus on preparing for this 2019 senatorial bid, which he would eventually win.  \n\nHe currently serves as Senate majority floor leader, and chairs the committee on ethics and privileges and the committee on rules. Previously, before the leadership changes in the chamber, he chaired the committee on justice and human rights and the blue ribbon committee.\n\nIn the 18th Congress, in recognition of his experience as longtime mayor and as MMDA chief, he was named chairperson of the Senate committee on local government and of the committee on urban planning, housing, and resettlement.\n\nTolentino is a law graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University, and has earned three masterals in law from universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. An Armed Forces of the Philippines reservist, he also holds a master’s degree in national security administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines.\n\nHe is not married, but has a son that sits as the No. 1 councilor of Tagaytay City.",
